Speaker 0: exercise outside. I suppose if you could find that time, it will be relaxing, I suppose, to help, you know, good for your diabetes as well, wouldn't it, if we could. I just want to sum up, Paul, if you don't mind. Please correct me if I've got any of it wrong. You've had this cough and sore throat for the last three days.

It's sort of nothing makes it really better, although you have taken your paracetamol. That's helped a little bit. You've not had any blood in that phlegm, no fever, no unexplained weight loss. Breathing's okay as well. You've got type two diabetes because you take tablets for that, and it's well controlled, and so is your blood pressure.

Your dad died sadly of a stroke. You live with your girlfriend, and you're quite happy. Work is good, and you just really want us to sort out your sore throat and cough.

Speaker 1: Yes, please.

Speaker 0: Okay. Okay. Is there anything else you want to add to that before we move on?

Speaker 1: No. No. That's it, I think.

Speaker 0: Alright. Okay. Well, what we need to do now is to check some vital signs, and I need to examine you before we could decide, you know, what's going on with your sore throat and cough and take it from there. Is that okay with you? That's fine.

Good. Thank you. Well, that concludes our demonstration of the history taking process. Paul is a senior lecturer at the university and has kindly offered to give feedback from a patient perspective. The key principles used in the history taking process was first and foremost me as the practitioner ensuring that the environment was safe and accessible for the patient.

I was also mindful to avoid interruptions, thus maintaining the patient's privacy and confidentiality. As I called the patient in, I was mindful not to use the patient's first name, but to seek permission. So how did you feel about that, Paul?

Speaker 1: I I thought that was quite appropriate, and I felt that you you respected my right to be called mister mister Collins or Paul accordingly. And I was happy to be Paul called Paul.

Speaker 0: Great. I also felt it was imperative that I gained informed consent, and so I told the patient at the outset what was to be expected and seek consent from him. I also thought that it was important that I use an open ended question at the outset so that the patient could tell his story in his own words. How did you find that?

Speaker 1: I I thought that was good, and I certainly had the opportunity to talk about what was concerning, which was obviously the cough. So, yeah, I got that out the way quite quickly, I think.

Speaker 0: Great. All good. The other thing is although I'm wanting the patient to tell their own story, I also am mindful of the red flags, thus ruling out life threatening causes. I try to be systematic, but I also wanted to respond to the patient cues as well. And so whenever the patient gave a leading answer, I would allow him the scope to explore that further.

I then went through the key processes of history taking and then allowed at the very end to sum up, thus allowing the patient to clarify it from their perspective. I was mindful as well not to use jargons. But how did you feel? Do because sometimes we get lost as practitioners, and we we see medical jargons as normal terminology.

Speaker 1: I think on on the whole, was very good. And for the most part, it was fairly free of medical jargon. Although I know at one point, you did ask about social history, which Right. Which I think had the potential to confuse somebody.

Speaker 0: Of course. I didn't think of it like that, but that's so right. Absolutely. Great.

Speaker 1: I mean, the questions once you once you'd said you're gonna ask about social history, I think the questions were absolutely fine. Sure. It's just that just that headlining really of that particular area for history taking that perhaps

Speaker 0: That's and that's important for me to note as a practitioner. Well, that concludes the key steps in history taking process, and we hope that we've helped you to add structure and depth to your history taking in clinical setting. And I will put some referencing online for you that will help you to explore further the key issues surrounding history taking. Thank you very much.
